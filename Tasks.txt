  - ğŸ˜˜Warum geht der Ghost nach -1/28 statt bei 1/1 stehen zu bleiben?
  - ğŸ˜˜Warum geht die Anzeige kaputt?
  - Have different scatter goals per ghost

- ğŸ˜˜Fix the missing ways at 7/14 and 8/14
- ğŸ˜˜Turn AnimationTestPage into a GamePage that plays the game
- ğŸ˜˜Let the ghosts start in scatter mode
- ğŸ˜˜Implement individual ghosts behaviours in scatter mode
- ğŸ˜˜Ghosts general behaviour:
  - ğŸ˜˜At each tile they choose a new target tile to go toward.
  - ğŸ˜˜Then they inspect all neighbour tiles
  - ğŸ˜˜A tile that is in opposite direction is removed.
  - ğŸ˜˜Tiles in a wall are removed.
  - ğŸ˜˜From the remaining moves, the distance to the target is calculated. The closest one is chosen as the next tile.
  - ğŸ˜˜If there are multiple tiles with the same distance, the tiles are prioritized. Up is highest.
  - ğŸ˜˜Then the new direction is chosen towards the new tile
- ğŸ˜˜When the ghost reaches a position that would make it stand still, choose the first free direction that is not backward instead.
- ğŸ˜˜Make ghost#wayPoints a @computed value - dependent on tileCoordinates and targetTile
- ğŸ˜˜Fix chooseNextTile() / Found no candidate
- ğŸ˜˜Support tunnel
- ğŸ˜˜SShow ghost targets
- ğŸ˜˜Implement individual ghosts behaviours in hunt mode:
  - ğŸ˜˜Blinky: PacMan
  - ğŸ˜˜Pinky: The tile 4 tiles in front of pacman. Only if pacman is facing up, pinkys target is 4 tiles up and 4 tiles to the left.
  - ğŸ˜˜Inky:
    o ğŸ˜˜An intermediate tile is chosen. It is 2 tiles in front of pacman. Only if pacman is facing up, pinkys target is 2 tiles up and 2 tiles to the left.
    o ğŸ˜˜Then the vector from the intermediate tile to Blinky is rotated 180 degrees. This is inkys target tile.
  - ğŸ˜˜Clyde:
    o ğŸ˜˜When >= 8 tiles away from pacMan: Target is PacMan.
    o ğŸ˜˜When < 8 tiles away: Same tile as in scatter mode.
- ğŸ˜˜After 7 seconds, go to hunt mode. After another 20 seconds, go to back to scatter mode
- ğŸ˜˜Enable ghosts to through the tunnel
- ğŸ˜˜findNextTile: Always use waypoints[1] as the next tile instead of searching through waypoints
- ğŸ˜˜Let ghosts move slower in tunnel
- ğŸ˜˜Remove ghost.timestamp
- ğŸ˜˜When entering chase mode, ghosts turn direction 180 degrees
- ğŸ˜˜When entering scatter mode, ghosts turn direction 180 degrees
- When pac man dies
   - ğŸ˜˜let all ghosts pause
   - ğŸ˜˜wait 5 seconds
   - When pac man has some live left
      - ğŸ˜˜revive pac man
      - ğŸ˜˜reset the ghosts
   - ğŸ˜˜ When pac man lost all lives
      - ğŸ˜˜Hide the ghosts and pac man and show "Game Over"
- ğŸ˜˜ Separate SCREEN_TILE_SIZE and SPRITE_TILE_SIZE.
- ğŸ˜˜ When I go to the bottom directly after start, the maze moves around on the screen. Probably because of the target sprite outside the maze.
  - ğŸ˜˜ Debug approach:
    - ğŸ˜˜ in Game constructor, place pac man and ghosts at the bottom
    - ğŸ˜˜ Add a pause key
  - ğŸ˜˜ Idea to fix:
    - ğŸ˜˜ Have a container for all sprites (= Board)
    - ğŸ˜˜ Set it to overflow: none
- ğŸ˜˜ Switch Ant to v4
- ğŸ˜˜ Have ghost state view
- ğŸ˜˜Ghosts that kills pac man enters scatter mode many times, over and over This is most visible in game over, when this happens forever.
- Frightened Mode:
  - ğŸ˜˜ Detect collions with energizers
    - ğŸ˜˜ Increase score
    - ğŸ˜˜ Remove energizer
  - When Pac man eats an energizer
      - ğŸ˜˜ Ghosts enter frightened state
      - ğŸ˜˜ Pac Man enters chasing state
      - ğŸ˜˜ the Frightened timer gets reset to 0
      - ğŸ˜˜ game.killed ghost counter get reset to 0

    - on collision a ghost dies
      - ğŸ˜˜ its state becomes "dead"
      - ğŸ˜˜ dead ghost counter increments
      - ğŸ˜˜ score increases 100, 200, 400, 800
      - ğŸ˜˜ The ghost shows the "eyes" sprite
      - ğŸ˜˜ No collision detection with a dead ghost
      - ğŸ˜˜ Can I use a broken number as target for the ghost? To guide it back to the house? And out of the house? It would be 13.5/11

ğŸ˜˜ Bug: After a ghost died, it ignores walls and just always moves in the same direction.
  - ğŸ˜˜ The problem seems to be that the ghost never meets a tile center. This is problem a consequence of the frightened ghost moving at half speed.... A solution would be change speed only at a tile center.
ğŸ˜˜ Bug: After a ghost died, the energizer timer gets reset to 0. That's not supposed to happen.
  - Dead ghosts:
    - ğŸ˜˜ Go to the box
    - ğŸ˜˜ Why can't they pass into the box anymore?
      - ğŸ˜˜ Write a test
    - ğŸ˜˜ Write timer: TimeoutTimer
- ğŸ˜˜ Move Score to the top
- ğŸ˜˜ Change extra live direction

- ğŸ˜˜ Add GameDebugView with Restart Game
- ğŸ˜˜ Move Revive PacMan to PacManDebugView

  - ğŸ˜˜ in Pacmans chasing state
    - when the energizer timer exceeds the chasing time,
      - ğŸ˜˜ Pac man goes back to eating mode
      - ğŸ˜˜ Alive Ghosts go to scatter state
  - in frightened state Ghosts
    - ğŸ˜˜ They show a frightened sprite
    - ğŸ˜˜ They move slowly
    - ğŸ˜˜ In each tile they choose a random direction that is not backward and not into a wall
    - ğŸ˜˜ When late in the frightened phase, they show the "late frightened" sprite
    - ğŸ˜˜ During the last 2 seconds of being frightened they show a white and blue blinking sprite
    - ğŸ˜˜ Fix bug where ghost in tunnel doesnt follow its target tile. Seems to happen also when pacman hits one of the ghosts. With all ghosts.
- ğŸ˜˜ Support notebook screen - make debug view smaller

- ğŸ˜˜ Don't pause ghosts on pac mans death
- ğŸ˜˜ Run Tests on git push
- ğŸ˜˜ Margin on the Game Page
- ğŸ˜˜ Score for killing ghosts
- ğŸ˜˜ Add margin for app
- ğŸ˜˜ Extract model directory
- ğŸ˜˜ Move Page specific components to page directory
- ğŸ˜˜ Bug: Switching between pages multiplies game speed
- ğŸ˜˜ Clean up onTimeElapsed
- ğŸ˜˜ Extract PacMan.moveBy
- ğŸ˜˜ Remove setter actions from Store
- ğŸ˜˜ Bug: Switching between pages doesn't reset the game
- ğŸ˜˜ Hide debug panel if screen is not wide enough, because the game doesn't really work with the panel
below the maze.
- ğŸ˜˜ UI based tests

- Remove XState

- Viewport for mobile.
  Alternative: Always render at factor 1 and then apply a transform, based on current viewport width

- Touch based game play for mobile
